For new term requests, please provide the following information:

## Preferred term label

(e.g., carnivore)

## Synonyms

(e.g., zoophage)

## Textual definition

The definition should be understandable even for non-specialists, preferably in Aristotelian form (i.e. a genus, which is an immediate parent term of the concept, e.g. heterotroph, followed by a differentia, e.g. that consume animals). Include a DOI to refer to any relevant article that acts as a source for the provided definition.

## Suggested parent term

Please look in the hierarchy in a browser such as [Agroportal](http://agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/SFWO) or using your favorite ontology editor.

## Suggested logical definition

You may try to provide a logical definition that mirrors the textual definition and that uses other terms from the ontology.
(e.g. heterotroph and eats some Metazoa)

## Attribution

If you would like a nanoattribution, please indicate your ORCID id
